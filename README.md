# My Blazor Web App Portfolio

Welcome to my Blazor web app portfolio! This project showcases my skills in developing dynamic web applications using Blazor. It includes two main features: a Flash Card application and a Daily Recipe app. Below, you'll find detailed descriptions of each page along with their unique functionalities.

## Flash Card Application

The goal for this application was to gain hands-on experience in building an app that not only includes features like creating, managing, and studying flashcards, but also serves as a personal tool to prepare for technical interviews.

### Features:
- **Create Flash Cards:** Users can easily add flashcards with front and back text to a specific set.
- **Manage Sets:** Each set of flashcards can be updated or deleted, providing flexibility in managing study materials.
- **Study and Shuffle:** When studying, users can shuffle the cards within a set to ensure a varied learning experience every time.
- **Update and Delete Cards:** Flexibility is key; users can update details on existing cards or remove them as needed.

## Daily Recipe App

The Daily Recipe App taps into the rich database of the Spoonacular API to deliver delicious recipes to users with the click of a button.

### Features:
- **Random Recipe Generator:** Users can discover new recipes daily by clicking the "Show Me a Random Recipe" button.
- **Recipe Display:** Each recipe is shown with an appealing image and a detailed description, making it easy to follow along and enjoy cooking.

#### API Integration
- **Spoonacular API:** This app makes API calls to Spoonacular, rendering recipes directly from their extensive database.
